## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this challenge I learned how to create JavaScript functions based on screen size and add an automatic page reload whenever the page gets resized. I also learned that object-fit: cover along with object-position allows you to only show a cropped version of an image based on your specifications.

### Continued development

This was my first challenge where I used CSS custom properties and it definitely made the css portion easier. I will be continuing to use the custom properties in the future.

### Useful resources

- [object-fit](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit) - This had a great overview of all the different object-fit options for when you are working with images
